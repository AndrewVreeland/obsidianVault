## Discussion Questions

1.  What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
	1. The efficiency of the operations that need to be performed on the data. Efficiency includes considerations such as time complexity (how fast an operation executes) and space complexity (how much memory an operation uses).
2.  How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
	1. 1.  Define a base case: A base case is a condition that indicates when the recursion should stop. It provides a stopping condition for the recursive function, preventing it from calling itself indefinitely. Ensure that your recursive function includes a proper base case that will be reached eventually, allowing the recursion to terminate.
