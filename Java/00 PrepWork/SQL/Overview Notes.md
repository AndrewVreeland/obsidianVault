Relational databases are a type of database management system that organizes data into tables with rows and columns. These tables can then be related to each other based on common data points, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of information.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases. It allows users to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as creating, modifying, and deleting tables and data, as well as retrieving and filtering data based on specific criteria.

Some key features of relational databases and SQL include:

1.  ACID compliance: Relational databases are designed to be ACID-compliant, which means that they ensure data consistency and integrity. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
    
2.  Data normalization: Relational databases use a process called normalization to reduce data redundancy and improve data consistency.
    
3.  SQL queries: SQL provides a wide range of commands and functions that allow users to retrieve and manipulate data in a variety of ways, from simple queries to complex joins and subqueries.
    
4.  Indexing: Relational databases use indexing to improve query performance by allowing for faster data retrieval.
    
5.  Data security: Relational databases provide built-in security features to protect data from unauthorized access and ensure data privacy.
