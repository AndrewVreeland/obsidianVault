[[SQL Lesson 2 Queries]]
[[SQL Lesson 8 A short note on NULLs]]
If the two tables have asymmetric data, which can easily happen when data is entered in different stages, then we would have to use a `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` or `FULL JOIN` instead to ensure that the data you need is not left out of the results.

Select query with LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOINs on multiple tables

`SELECT column, another_column, … FROM mytable **INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN another_table ON mytable.id = another_table.matching_id** WHERE _condition(s)_ ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;`

Like the `INNER JOIN` these three new joins have to specify which column to join the data on.  
When joining table A to table B, a `LEFT JOIN` simply includes rows from A regardless of whether a matching row is found in B. The `RIGHT JOIN` is the same, but reversed, keeping rows in B regardless of whether a match is found in A. Finally, a `FULL JOIN` simply means that rows from both tables are kept, regardless of whether a matching row exists in the other table.

When using any of these new joins, you will likely have to write additional logic to deal with `NULL`s in the result and constraints (more on this in the next lesson).

Did you know?

You might see queries with these joins written as `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`, or `FULL OUTER JOIN`, but the `OUTER` keyword is really kept for SQL-92 compatibility and these queries are simply equivalent to `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN` respectively.
